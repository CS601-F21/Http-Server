                    i was looking for a solution for my samsung galaxy nexus device to steady it for shooting 
                    fireworks at night  it is cheaply built  but more important a decent sized phone doesnt fit in the holder 
                     save your cash and find another solution because unleess you have an older iphone  youre probably out of luck
                    </li>

                        my husband  i were sharing one car charger between two cars  this plan was not working out so welli bought this because i have a 
                        motorola phone and wanted to make sure it would be compatible in realityi just wanted the glowing blue circlethe charger does work 
                        quickly  ive had no problems charging my atrix hd it is a micro usb charger so it also fits my husbands samsung galaxy3 my sons 
                        nokia lumia and ive used it to charge the kindle fireworks fast looks good  excellent buy  ive had it since early august and there 
                        have been no issues  i do keep it in my vehicle and it doesnt get moved around or handled very much im not sure if that makes a difference 
                        but wanted to note it now in case there are problems in the future  it is used at least 5 days per week

                        my girlfriend recommended these chargers when we were away celebrating our 50th birthdays  now i have one and all the kids have them for 
                        their phones or ds or ipod so they can charge anything at anytime glad i had mine in disney when we were watching the fireworks show

                        though im not a expert in cell phone chargers this thing works good but its not all fireworks and hotel parties its a charger and 
                        it works so i guess buy it
